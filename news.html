			<h2>
				Adopting Saves Lives
			</h2>
			<p>

				There are many myths that abound in the US but in particular overseas. The list is long as to why
				adopting a rescue is the humane choice. Direct Line published this informative article.
				The article debunks many of the myths surrounding rescue animals. I think it can be summed up simply by
				saying that it makes sense to SAVE A LIFE versus buying from a breeder and adding to the problem.

				Fur-ever home in Chicago
			</h2>
			<p>
				Whitey – now Juliet, one of the 100’s of thousands of rescues in Houston, where the stray population is
				roughly 1.5 million, has found her fur-ever home in Chicago.

				Thank you ISDF for helping to cross post this sweet, 2 year old Cattle dog and thank you Dawn for
				meeting with the Halvey family at O’Hare for the cargo pick up.

				Juliet is settling nicely in her new home.

			<h2>
				Meet Maya, Tara & Raj
			</h2>
			<p>
				Maya, Tara, and Raj were born in early December 2015. ISDF’s dear rescue friend, Mini Seth Kapoor, saw
				the puppies with mom when they were quite young. She dreamed of rescuing all five, but knew the
				situation in Delhi made this mere fantasy – so many dogs in need, so few homes for them all. Mini also
				lacked the funds for overseas travel and adoption at the time, due to her dedicated work helping so many
				of the Delhi street dogs.

						Soi Dog is coming to Korea!  They have short and long term plans working on the government level. Soi Dog sterilization program is supporting our spaying/neutering the dogs and this time with the bus ad. This banner will be on the both side of line 88 buses from the 27th August. 13 buses all together running the streets of Bucheon, Incheon and Seoul till next year August 2017. Bucheon city is our target. Thank you sponsors!

						Translated, the ads are carrying this message:
						“Dog! Dogs are not for eating – they are our companions.
						There is no differentiation between a ‘pet dog’ and a ‘meat dog’.
						How would you feel if your pet ended up in a slaughterhouse?”
						
						The Soi Dog Foundation is the largest animal welfare agency in SE Asia based in Thailand.  They have changed the landscape for dogs in Thailand and have had tremendous impact throughout SE Asia.  They have virtually ended the dog meat trade in Thailand, helped to enact and enforce animal welfare laws in Thailand and other SE Asia countries.  They have curbed the tide of street dogs through effective spay and neuter programs.  This is an organization that is worthy of our utmost respect and admiration.  It was all started by John and Gill Dailey – two people with a passion and a strong determination.  Never underestimate your abilities and how your actions will spread and multiply to bring about change and good in the world.

				Kudos to the Brazil Olympics.  The ball handlers were once roaming the streets of Sao Paulo as street dogs.  These dogs were selected to be trained and work the Olympics to show case that street dogs are highly trainable in hopes of promoting their adoptability.  What a wonderful message to send to Brazil and the world.  Street dogs are so often overlooked and they are treasures just waiting to be discovered!  Please click here for full story.

						155 mile marathon across the Gobi Desert and a very determined dog.  He followed a runner, Dion Leonard, the entire way and in doing so stole his heart and ended up forming a bond that led to him joining Dion in the UK.  For those of you who have traveled abroad and had a street dog speak to your heart knows how hard it is to part ways.  So desperate for human attention they will follow you as long as you let them even if it means taking them out of their safety zone into other dog’s territories which can be very unsafe for them.  Many a street dogs have left lasting memories to the tourists that visit their countries and broken hearts when they had to part.  I often receive calls from tourists who fell in love with a dog while abroad.  Here is what I tell them “Where there is a will there is a way.  Take them home and you will never regret it”
